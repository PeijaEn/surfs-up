# Surfs-Up, a Weather Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis
My client reached out to me to inquire about opening a surf shop. Utilizing weather data from Hawaii, I was able to pull some numbers to help the client make a choice. The client was espically interested in the months of June and December(in 2017). The thinking is if it is good in the winter and summer, it is good year round.

### Results

3 differences are:
1) June has 100+ more data points
2) There is more rainfall in December than June
3) The max amount of rainfall is more in December

### Analysis
Based off of the data collected, the months of December and June are pretty similar. The data wasn't skewed towards either month as well. Two additional queries I would recommend before the client opens the shop would be to check the months of September and March. If all of the data is relatively close, as in 1-2 inches, then I would continue with the plan to open the surf shop.
