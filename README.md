# Surfs-Up, a Weather Analysis

### Overview of the Analysis
My client reached out to me to inquire about opening a surf shop. Utilizing weather data from Hawaii, I was able to pull some numbers to help the client make a choice. The client was espically interested in the months of June and December. The thinking is if it is good in the winter and summer, it is good year round.
